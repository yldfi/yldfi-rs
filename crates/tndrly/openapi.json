    "description": "# Introduction\n\nThe Tenderly API provides a programmatic interface for managing Tenderly resources using standard HTTP requests.\nIt mirrors many functionalities available through the Tenderly Dashboard, enabling you to script complex actions. The API documentation includes a design and technology overview, followed by detailed endpoint information.\n\n[Log into your Tenderly account](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/login) to automatically populate your API credentials in the documentation. Your account ID and project slug will be pre-filled across the documentation, excluding the API access token for security reasons. \n\nBase URL: `https://api.tenderly.co/api`\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe Tenderly API requires an access token to authenticate your requests. Learn how to [generate and manage your API access keys](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/how-to-generate-api-access-token).\n\nAdd `X-Access-Key` to each request header, e.g.:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'https://api.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/${TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG}/simulate' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: ${TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY}' \\\n  ...\n```\n\nDo not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nAuthentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.\n\nIf you need to authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'https://api.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/${TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG}/simulate' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TENDERLY_TOKEN>' \\\n  ...\n```\n\nAll API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.\n\n## Requests\n\nAny tool capable of making HTTP requests can interact with the API by requesting the appropriate URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol to ensure that traffic is encrypted. \n\nThe API's response varies with the request method used.\n\n|Method|Usage|\n|--- |--- |\n|GET|Used to retrieve information about your account, project, or resources. The requested information is returned as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests. Requests made using the GET method are read-only and will not affect the objects you are querying.|\n|DELETE|Used to destroy a resource and remove it from your account and project. This methods removes the specified object if it is found. If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. You do not have to check if the resource is available prior to issuing a DELETE command. The final state will be the same regardless of its existence.|\n|PUT|Used to update the information about a resource in your account. The PUT method sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.|\n|PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|\n|POST|Used to create a new object. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.|\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API responds with standard HTTP statuses, including error codes that indicate the outcome of requests. In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the\nbody of the response will usually contain additional information about the problem.\n\n|Status Code|Type|Description|\n|--- |--- |--- |\n|200|OK|Everything worked as expected.|\n|400|Bad Request|The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.|\n|401|Unauthorized|No valid API key provided.|\n|402|Request Failed|The parameters were valid but the request failed.|\n|403|Forbidden|The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.|\n|404|Not Found|The requested resource doesn’t exist.|\n|429|Too Many Requests|Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.|\n|500, 502, 503, 504|Server Errors|Something went wrong on Tenderly’s end.|\n\nBoth 400 and 500 level errors return a JSON object in the response body, containing specific attributes detailing the error.\n\n|Name|Type|Description|\n|--- |--- |--- |\n|id|string|Endpoints include an error ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.|\n|slug|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be \"not_found.\"|\n|message|string|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.|\n\n### Example error response\n\nHTTP/1.1 404 Bad request\n```json\n{\n\"error\": {\n  \"id\": \"596b1dc7-af60-477b-aab3-6c93eb92ddfa\",\n  \"slug\": \"bad_request\",\n  \"message\": \"Bad request input parameters\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n## Responses\n\nWhen a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in\nthe form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is\nprocessed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty\nresponse body.\n\nThe value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a\nsingle object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of\nobjects.\n\n### Response for a single object\n\n```json\n{\n  \"simulation\": {\n    \"id\": \"123\"\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Response for an object collection\n\n```json\n{\n  \"simulations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"123\"\n      \"...\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"1234\"\n      \"...\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination\n\nBy default, 20 objects are returned per page per request.\nYou can customize this behavior using the following parameters:\n\n* **Pagination Limit (perPage)**: To change the number of items per page,\nappend `?perPage=[number]` to your request. For example, `?perPage=2` limits\nthe results to two items per page. The maximum limit is 100 items per page.\n* **Page Offset (page)**: To navigate through paginated results, use the\n`?page=[number]` parameter. For instance, `?page=3` will take you to the third page of the results.\nOnly positive integers are valid for this parameter.\n\nRemember:\n\n* You can combine these parameters. For example, `?perPage=10&page=2` will show the second page with 10 items per page.\n* The maximum number of results per page (`perPage`) is 100.\n\n## Rate limits\n\nRequests through the API are rate limited per `X-Access-Key` API key. Current rate limits:\n\n* **Non-authenticated users:** 100 requests per minute\n* **Authenticated users:** 400 requests per minute\n\nOnce you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle\nstarts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for\nthe best results.\n\nThe rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of\neach request. The relevant headers are:\n\n* **X-Tdly-Limit**: The number of requests that can be made per minute.\n* **X-Tdly-Remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.\n* **X-Tdly-Reset-Timestamp**: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more information about how request limits expire.\n\nAs long as the `X-Tdly-Remaining` count is above zero, you will be able\nto make additional requests.\n\nThe way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count\nis important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for a\nminute and resetting the `X-Tdly-Remaining` value at the end of the minute,\neach request instead has its own timer.\n\nThis means that each request contributes toward the `X-Tdly-Remaining`\ncount for one complete minute after the request is made. When that request's\ntimer runs out, it is no longer counted toward the request limit.\n\nThis has implications on the meaning of the `X-Tdly-Reset-Timestamp` header as\nwell. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of\nthis header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.\n\nKeep this in mind if you see your `X-Tdly-Reset-Timestamp` value change, but not\nmove an entire minute into the future.\n\nIf the `X-Tdly-Remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive\na 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. \n\n`X-Tdly-Remaining` reaching zero can also indicate that the \"burst limit\" of 250 \nrequests per minute limit was met, even if the 400 requests per minute limit was not. \n\nYou can see the format of the response in the examples. \n\n**Note:** Some endpoints may have special rate limit requirements that\nare independent of the limits defined above.\n\n### Sample rate limit headers\n\n```bash\n'X-Tdly-Limit': 100\n'X-Tdly-Remaining': 79\n'X-Tdly-Reset-Timestamp': 1402425459\n```\n\n### Sample rate exceeded response\n\n429 Too Many Requests\n```bash\n{\n  id: \"too_many_requests\",\n  message: \"API Rate limit exceeded.\"\n}\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\nThere are two different ways to pass parameters in a request to the API.\n\nWhen passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be\npassed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and\nvalues as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that\nyou are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the\n`Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request\nis interpreted correctly.\n\nWhen passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can\nbe passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters\nwould be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the\nURI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be\nseparated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when\ngiven parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and\nthen passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the\nform of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an\nequal sign.\n\n### Pass parameters as a JSON object\n\n```bash\ncurl 'https://api.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/${TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG}/simulate' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: ${TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY}' \\\n  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data-raw '{\"network_id\":\"1\",\"block_number\":null,\"transaction_index\":null,\"from\":\"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\"input\":\"0x42966c68000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022b\",\"to\":\"0x94c87a7b26980ae7aaa361c5c7e03e632ab36e6c\",\"gas\":8000000,\"gas_price\":\"0\",\"value\":\"0\",\"access_list\":[],\"generate_access_list\":true,\"save\":true,\"block_header\":null}' \\\n  --compressed\n```\n\n### Pass filter parameters as a query string\n\n```bash\ncurl 'https://api.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/${TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG}/simulations?page=1&perPage=20' \\\n  -H 'X-Access-Key: ${TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY}' \\\n  --compressed\n```\n\n## Cross origin resource sharing\n\nIn order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements\nCross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.\n\nCORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain\nthat the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects\nlike control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can\nsend requests to an outside domain.\n\nThe procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions\n(other than GET requests) begins by sending a \"preflight\" request. This sets\nthe `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply\nwith the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The\nclient then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed\nconstraints.\n\nThis process is usually done by the browser in the background, but you can\nuse curl to emulate this process. The headers that will be set to show the constraints are:\n\n* **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an `Origin` header.\n* **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.\n* **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.\n* **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.\n* **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It basically allows you to send your Access token for authentication.\n\nYou should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,\nbecause the browser will typically do all of the work for you.\n",

        "description": "Call the `simulate` endpoint to preview the outcomes a single transaction before sending it to the live network. You can simulate transactions with custom parameters on [105+ supported networks](https://docs.tenderly.co/supported-networks-and-languages). The output provides detailed insights into emitted events, state changes, asset and balance changes, among other things. \n\nLearn about [single transaction simulations](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations).\n\nThe response returns the following objects:\n\n`transaction`: Contains data related to the transaction, including its hash, block number, origin and destination addresses, gas details, input data, nonce, and other transaction details, like the status, timestamp, and involved contract addresses.\n\n`simulation`: Contains data about the simulated transaction. It provides details related to the ID of the simulation, project and owner IDs, block number where the transaction was included, gas used, method invoked, simulation status, and other metadata.\n\n`contracts`: Contains data about the contract(s) involved in the transaction, including the contract's ID, network ID, balance, verification status, associated standards (like ERC20), token-specific data if the contract is a token, compiler version, and even the source code of the contract in some cases.\n\n`generated_access_list`: Contains a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction will access, enabling certain gas cost optimizations. The access list is a feature introduced in [Ethereum's EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930).",
